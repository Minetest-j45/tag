# tag
A simple minetest mod that adds tag into the game.<br>
It is recommended to use with MTG and with no other mods, and also recommended to make a container for players so they dont go too far.<br>
To start a game of tag, do /tag_new (tag priviledge needed) and to end a game of tag, do /end_tag (tag priviledge needed).
